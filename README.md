### Hi Devs, I’m Samarth👋

Performance focused engineer who enjoys reasoning about systems, profiling bottlenecks, and turning slow or fragile codepaths into predictable, scalable ones.

> Currently building **Perfolyze**, a performance monitoring platform obsessed with real world latency, throughput, and production behavior.

## 🧠 About Me


<table>
<tr>
<td width="60%" valign="top">

* I like understanding *why* systems behave the way they do under load
* I care deeply about performance, correctness, and long term maintainability
* I enjoy working close to the metal when needed, and close to users when it matters
* I prefer simple architectures that scale through good decisions, not patches
* I’m comfortable owning features end to end, from design to production

## 🔬 Things I’ve Built

### 🔹 Perfolyze

A performance monitoring and analysis platform.

* Focuses on real world production metrics rather than synthetic benchmarks
* Helps identify bottlenecks across frontend and backend boundaries
* Designed with observability, low overhead, and signal to noise ratio in mind

### 🔹 Peer Connect

A hackathon matchmaking system.

* Matches participants and teams based on skills and intent
* Optimized for fast discovery and low friction onboarding
* Built with a strong focus on UX performance and responsiveness

### 🔹 Envoy Config RS

A Rust based systems experiment.

* Explores configuration management patterns
* Focus on safety, determinism, and correctness
* Used as a learning ground for low level design decisions
